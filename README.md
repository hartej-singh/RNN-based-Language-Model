# CSE4022-NLP-DA-RNN-based-Language-Model
 The development of languages over time result in changing the language models of such languages and makes the language models more and more complicated over time. This can lead to a mixture of words that have the same meaning but different spellings (synonyms) and some words that have the similar spelling but different meanings (homophones) in different scenarios. This is where Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) proves to be useful. RNNs effectively have an internal memory that allows the previous inputs to affect the subsequent predictions. Itâ€™s much easier to predict the next word in a sentence with more accuracy if you know what the previous words were.
